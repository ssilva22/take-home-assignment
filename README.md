# Take-home assignment

 #### This project is the solution to the algorithm  assignment that asks you to find the smallest positive integer that does not occur in a sequence

## Instructions:

***First You're going to need to clone the repository in order to use it so you are going to open your terminal and run the following command***

> `git clone https://github.com/ssilva22/take-home-assignment.git`

***After cloning your repo you need to make sure to install the dependencies so tha the project is up and running so make sure to run***

> `npm install`

***All tests are going to be skipped so if you want to check if the tests are working just make sure you run***

> `npm test `

***Note:All tests are going to be skipped so in order to have them running you're going to go to src and open  script.test.ts and remove the x from "xit" so that it says "it", go one by one to see if all the tests are working correctly***

*If you would like to compile your typescript code make sure you run `npm run build` and a dist folder should be created with 4 js files , 2 for configuration, 1 for the code and 1 for the testing file*
